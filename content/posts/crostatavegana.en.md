The preparation of the shortcrust pastry, custard and gelatine of this tart does not require the use of milk, eggs and butter, which are normally found in the recipes of this dessert, making it vegan.
Almond milk has a strong, sweet flavor, and the tart will therefore have an intense flavor.

* Now switch to the shortcrust pastry:
     * In a bowl combine the sugar, the oil, the water, the flour and the yeast
     * Stir with your hands until you create a dough that does not stick to your fingers
     * Roll out with a rolling pin to create the base of the tart
     * Place the pastry in a greased and floured cake pan and trim the edges with a knife
     * With a fork prick the base, place a sheet of parchment paper on it and fill it with weights, for cooking in white
     * Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and the weights and cook for another 10 minutes
     * Remove the base from the oven and let it cool
     * Pour the cream on the base and level
  * Finally, create the fruit jelly:
     * In a saucepan, combine the sugar, corn starch and water
     * Use a whisk to thicken the gelatine
