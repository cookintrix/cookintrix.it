The octopus rag√π is very tasty but still light.
Impossible not to fall in love with it.

## Ingredients (4 servings)

* 400 g of tortiglioni
* 1 whole clean octopus (approximately 800 g)
* 1/2 onion
* 1 clove of garlic
* 100 g of carrots
* 1 stick of celery
* 2 tablespoons of double tomato concentrate
* 6 tablespoons of tomato puree
* 1/2 glass of red wine (as the octopus is very tasty)
* parsley to taste
* coarse salt to taste
* oil to taste

## Steps

* Cut the octopus tentacles into chunks, following the size of the suckers
* Cut the octopus head into small pieces
* In a pan pour the oil and the clove of garlic and turn on the heat over high heat
* As soon as it starts to fry, after about 5 minutes, add the octopus
* Brown well, turning occasionally, for about 30 minutes
* Remove the garlic and deglaze with the red wine
* While the wine loses its alcoholic part, clean the carrots, the celery, the onion and the parsley
* Cut everything roughly and add to the pan
* Add the concentrate and puree and mix well
* Leave the sauce to flavor over low heat for about 45 minutes
* Put the water in a saucepan and put the pasta when it boils
* Drain it al dente and pour it into the pan
* Stir in a little cooking water only if the sauce is very thick
* Serve garnished with parsley

Enjoy your meal! üòÄ
