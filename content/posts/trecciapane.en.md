Only an hour and a half of leavening to make this soft and tasty braid of bread.

## Ingredients

* 250 g of milk
* 15 g of fresh brewer's yeast
* 550 g of flour
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1 teaspoon of sugar
* 50 g of olive oil
* 1 egg
* 1 yolk
* sesame seeds to taste

## Steps

* In a saucepan, heat the milk without bringing it to the boil
* Turn off the heat and add the yeast
* Stir until the latter dissolves completely
* Pour the milk into a bowl
* Add the flour, the salt and the sugar
* Begin to knead and then add the oil and the egg
* Knead until you get a dough (the consistency is elastic)
* Let the dough rest in the bowl covered with a kitchen towel for an hour
* After the time has passed, roll out the dough with a rolling pin, making sure to obtain a rectangle
* Divide into two equal parts
* By forming two cylinders knot them together creating a braid
* With a little dough create two strips to be placed at both ends as to close the braid obtained
* Leave the braid covered with the kitchen towel to rest for half an hour
* Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200Â° C if ventilated, 210Â° C if static
* After the leavening time, brush the braid with an egg yolk
* Sprinkle with sesame seeds
* Place in the oven and cook for half an hour
* Once cooked, wait for the bread to cool and serve

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
