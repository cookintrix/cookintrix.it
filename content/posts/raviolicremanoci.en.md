These homemade ravioli, with their mushroom filling and their walnut cream, are excellent to prepare for guests who want to savor the flavor of the mountain.

## Ingredients (4 servings)

1. For the pasta
* 2 eggs
* 400 g of flour
* a pinch of salt
2. For the filling
* 800 of champignon mushrooms
* 1 tablespoon of breadcrumbs
* parsley to taste
* salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* oil to taste
3. For the cream
* 100 g of walnuts
* 250 of cooking cream
* nutmeg to taste

## Steps

* Pour the flour on a pastry board or work surface
* Create a cavity in the center of the mixture, add the eggs and salt
* Start kneading the dough by adding water when it gets too hard
* Continue until it becomes homogeneous and without lumps
* Create a loaf, wrap it in cling film and let it rest for half an hour
* Using a rolling pin or the special pasta machine, make thin sheets, about 1 mm thick and set them aside
* Clean the mushrooms, cut them together with the parsley and sautÃ© them in a pan with a little oil
* Salt, pepper and cook for 15 minutes, adding breadcrumbs when the mushrooms release the water
* When they are ready, place them in a mixer until a homogeneous mixture is obtained
* Transfer the mixture into a sac-Ã -poche
* At this point, take up the pasta sheets, placing half of them on a surface
* Using the sac-Ã -poche, arrange the filling on the sheets, aligning them in small piles, about 3 cm away from each other
* Place the remaining sheets on top, matching the sheets
* Cut the ravioli with a pastry wheel
* In a saucepan put the water to boil and in the meantime prepare the cream
* Finely chop the walnuts
* Pour the cream into a pan and heat it over a warm flame
* Scrape some nutmeg and add it to the cream
* Add most of the nuts
* When the water boils, add salt and gently put the ravioli
* When they are cooked, drain them and transfer them to the pan
* Mix with the cream
* Serve everything by sprinkling the remaining grain

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
