These balls are easy to make, but mostly they are healthy and tasty.

## Ingredients

* 1 can of boiled chickpeas (drained weight 250 g)
* 200 g of green beans
* 100 g of breadcrumbs
* Salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* curry to taste
* oil to taste

## Steps

* Preheat the oven to 200Â° C if ventilated, 210Â° C if static
* Wash the green beans and cut the ends
* Heat a pan with enough water to cover the green beans and boil them
* Drain the green beans
* Drain the chickpeas from the can taking care not to throw away the liquid inside, which is called aquafaba
* Put the green beans, the chickpeas and a couple of tablespoons of aquafaba in a mixer
* Salt, pepper and add carry or other spices to taste
* Mix until you get a homogeneous mixture that is easy to handle and that is not too liquid or thick (in the first case add the breadcrumbs, in the second the aquafaba)
* At this point, create balls with the hands, first giving them the classic round shape and then squeezing them lightly
* Dip them in breadcrumbs
* Place them on a baking pan covered with parchment paper
* Brush them with oil
* Bake them for 20 minutes

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
