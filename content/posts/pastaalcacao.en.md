Just add cocoa to create tagliatelle with an original color and a bitter taste.

## Ingredients

* 360 g of flour
* 40 g of bitter cocoa
* 2 eggs
* half a glass of warm water
* a pinch of salt

## Steps (4 servings)

* Pour the flour and cocoa on a pastry board or work surface, mixing them
* Create a cavity in the center of the mixture, add the eggs and the salt
* Start working the dough by adding water when it gets too hard or lumpy
* Continue until it becomes homogeneous and without lumps
* Create a loaf, wrap it in cling film and let it rest for half an hour
* Using a rolling pin or the special pasta machine, make thin sheets, about 1 mm thick
* Flour the sheets, roll them obtaining cylinders and cut slices of 1/2 cm thick with a knife
* Unroll the cylinders and place the fettuccine obtained on a floured cloth until they are used

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
