A refined but tasty first course, which despite its strong and particular flavors is delicate, fresh and unforgettable.

## Ingredients (4 servings)

* 800 g of flour
* 4 eggs
* lukewarm water to taste
* a pinch of fine salt
* 500 g of prawns
* 300 g of yellow and red datterini tomatoes

* oil to taste
* a few tablespoons of [prawn bisque]({{< ref "/posts/bisquedigamberi.en.md" >}})

## Steps

1. For the pasta
     * Pour the flour onto a pastry board or work surface
     * Create a cavity in the center of the mixture, add the eggs and the salt
     * Start working the dough by adding water when it becomes too hard or lumpy
     * Continue until it becomes homogeneous and without lumps
     * Create a loaf, wrap it in cling film and let it rest for half an hour
     * Using a rolling pin or the special pasta machine, make thin sheets, about 2 mm thick
     * Flour the sheets, and with the help of a sharp knife cut out the spaghetti
     * Place the spaghetti obtained on a floured cloth until they are used
