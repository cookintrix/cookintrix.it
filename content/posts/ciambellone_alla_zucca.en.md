When one thinks of a dessert to cook for breakfast, the bundt cake immediately comes to mind, because its preparation is easy but the result is tasty.
I wanted to make it using pumpkin as the main ingredient, to add flavor and make the dessert even more delicate, in a vegan version.


## Ingredients

* 400 g of raw pumpkin
* 100 g of seed oil
* 100 g of water
* 100 g of sugar
* 150 g of flour
* a packet of baking powder (16 g)
* 50 g of granulated almonds
* a vial of vanilla flavoring
* powder sugar to taste

## Steps

* Preheat the oven to 180°
* Cut the pumpkin into cubes and blend it with the seed oil until getting a cream without lumps
* Put the water and sugar in a bowl; stir until the latter dissolves
* Add the pumpkin cream, the sifted flour, the baking powder, the granulated almonds and the vanilla flavoring
* Mix until getting a homogeneous mixture
* Grease a pan for bundt cake and pour the mixture
* Bake in a convection oven at 180° or in a static oven at 190° for 30 minutes
* When cooked, remove the pan from the oven and wait for the boundt cake to cool to remove it from the mold
* Sprinkle with powder sugar and serve

Enjoy your meal! 😀
