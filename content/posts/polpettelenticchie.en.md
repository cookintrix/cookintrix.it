* 400 g of stale bread
* water to taste
* 10 tablespoons of breadcrumbs
* 3 tablespoons of oil
* salt to taste

## Steps

* Place the bread in a bowl and pour enough water to cover it
* Leave it to soak until it softens
* Drain the water and squeeze the bread
* Put the bread, the lentils and 5 tablespoons of breadcrumbs in a mixer
* Pour two tablespoons of oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Add cumin or another spice to taste
* Operate the mixer and let it go until the mixture becomes homogeneous
* If the mixture is too soft and difficult to handle, add more breadcrumbs
* In a small bowl pour 5 tablespoons of breadcrumbs
* With your hands create round balls and pass them in the breadcrumbs
* In a pan pour a tablespoon of oil and place the balls
