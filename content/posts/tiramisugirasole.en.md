Tiramisu is one of the most popular desserts, and thanks to a particular mold I decided to propose it differently.

## Ingredients

* 4 fresh eggs
* 500 g of mascarpone
* 100 g of sugar
* 22 Pavesini
* 300 g of mocha coffee, sweetened
* bitter cocoa to taste
* sugared cocoa to taste

## Steps

* Carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks
* In a bowl, whip the egg yolks, with half the amount of sugar, with an electric whisk until the mixture becomes frothy
* Add the mascapone a little at a time until you get a compact cream
* Set the bowl aside and wash the electric whips thoroughly
* In a bowl, whip the egg whites with the remaining sugar until the mixture doesn't move even if the container is overturned
* Add the whipped egg whites to the cream, mixing very gently from bottom to top
* Take the sunflower-shaped mold
* Pour the cream into the mold taking care to distribute it evenly
* Level the surface
* Soak the Pavesini in the coffee for a few moments and distribute them on the cream, breaking them when needed to cover the whole mixture
* Put the mold in the freezer for at least 4 hours
* To serve tiramisu, remove it from the freezer 5 hours before put it on the table
* Once removed from the freezer, gently remove the mold, it will come off easily
* Sprinkle the center with sweetened cocoa and the petals with bitter cocoa

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
