Broth is a basic preparation, which is used to flavor countless dishes.
Since I made it at home for the first time, I couldn't do without it!

## Ingredients (4 servings)

* 2 l of water
* 2 carrots
* 1 zucchini
* 2 potatoes
* 4 tomatoes
* 1 stick of celery
* 1 onion
* Salt to taste
* 3 ounces of beef or chicken (if you want to prepare the meat broth and not the vegetable one)

## Steps

* Clean the vegetables
* Leave all ingredients whole
* Put themin a large pot and cover with the cold water
* Cook for one hour and in the meantime if needed skim the broth, or eliminate the impurities that arise on the surface
* Filter the broth through a colander, separating it from the ingredients
* Salt the broth only now to regulate the flavor
* The broth is ready to be used in your preparations

Enjoy your meal! ðŸ˜€
